# PowerGrade

As a former teacher, I know how important it is to be able to quicky manage classroom data. PowerGrade is a tool for teachers to create classes, add assignments, and view and edit grades.  

[Live App](https://powergrade-client.herokuapp.com/)
[Server-side repo]()

## Features:
Teachers can login to an existing account or register for the first time.

Teachers can learn how to use the app by clicking "Get Started"

Teachers then may change the pre-set category weights for each assignment type.  These weights will be used to calculate overall student averages.

This app comes "pre-loaded" with all of the students in the "school".  The teacher create a new class with a custom student list and name.

And later view a list of their classes and make edits.

After creating a class, the teacher can go to the assignments page and create assignments for each class.

He or she can then make edits to the assignments if they wish.

Once assignments have been added to the classes, the teacher can view their gradebook and add or edit student grades.  Overall student averages are calculated based on the gradebook category weights and displayed in the first column.  Assignment averages are calculated and displayed as well.
